## Goal Setting Guidelines

### Good Goals Are

- **Specific**: Clear enough to know when achieved
- **Measurable**: Has quantifiable success criteria
- **Achievable**: Challenging but realistic
- **Relevant**: Connects to mission and values
- **Time-bound**: Has a target date or iteration

### Goal Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Better Version |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| Vague | "Get better" | "Improve [metric] by X%" |
| Unmeasurable | "Make users happy" | "Achieve 4+ rating on [criteria]" |
| No deadline | "Eventually launch" | "Launch by [date]" |
| Too many | 10 active goals | 3-5 active goals max |

---

## Review Cadence

| Frequency | Activity |
|-----------|----------|
| Every iteration | Check task-level progress |
| Weekly | Review tactical goals |
| Monthly | Review strategic goals |
| Quarterly | Review goal hierarchy alignment |

---

## Priority Framework

When goals conflict, use this priority order:

1. **Safety goals** (from CONSTITUTION.md)
2. **Quality goals** (maintain standards)
3. **Learning goals** (build capability)
4. **Output goals** (produce deliverables)
5. **Efficiency goals** (do things faster)

---

## Current Focus

**This iteration's focus**: [Specific task or goal component]

**Key question to answer**: [What are you trying to learn or achieve?]

**Definition of "done" for today**: [Concrete deliverable]

---

## Blockers & Dependencies

| Goal | Blocker | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| [Goal] | [What's blocking] | [How to unblock] |

---

## Goal Metrics

Track goal-related metrics over time.

| Goal | Metric | Current | Target | Trend |
|------|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| [Goal 1] | [Metric] | [Value] | [Target] | [↑/↓/→] |
| [Goal 2] | [Metric] | [Value] | [Target] | [↑/↓/→] |

---

## Integration

### With LOOP.md
- Goals inform what to work on each iteration
- Iteration outcomes update goal progress

### With METRICS.md
- Goal metrics tracked in METRICS.md
- Success criteria tied to measurable outcomes

### With LEARNING.md
- Learning goals capture knowledge objectives
- Goal completion generates learnings

---

## Evolution

Goals change as:
- Circumstances change
- Learning reveals better targets
- Priorities shift
- Goals are completed

### Change Process

- Task-level changes: Self-approved
- Goal additions/removals: Log reasoning
- Priority changes: Justify in context of values
