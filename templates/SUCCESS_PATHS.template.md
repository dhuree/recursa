# Success Paths

<!--
TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use this to track proven routes to top-tier results
2. Update when new top-tier outputs are achieved
3. Review at meso-retrospectives for diversification
4. Remove this instruction block when done

Quick reference for known routes to top-tier quality outputs. Helps prevent over-exploitation of dominant paths while maintaining quality.

## Path Summary

**Total top-tier outputs: X** (as of iteration N)

| Approach | Count | Key Parameters | Notes |
|----------|-------|----------------|-------|
| <!-- Approach 1 --> | <!-- X --> | <!-- Key settings --> | <!-- Performance notes --> |
| <!-- Approach 2 --> | <!-- X --> | <!-- Key settings --> | <!-- Performance notes --> |

## Concentration Analysis

Track where your best results come from:

| Approach | % of Top-Tier | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| <!-- Approach 1 --> | <!-- X% --> | <!-- DOMINANT / BALANCED / UNDEREXPLORED --> |
| <!-- Approach 2 --> | <!-- X% --> | <!-- DOMINANT / BALANCED / UNDEREXPLORED --> |

**Concentration alert threshold**: If any single approach produces >60% of top-tier results, consider:
1. Is this concentration STRUCTURAL (inherent to the approach) or STRATEGIC (choice)?
2. Should you diversify, or accept the concentration and maximize it?

## Detailed Paths

### [Dominant Approach Name]

**Why it works**: <!-- Explain the mechanism that produces high quality -->

**Key parameters**:
- <!-- Parameter 1: optimal range -->
- <!-- Parameter 2: optimal range -->

**Known top-tier outputs**:
| Iter | Params | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| <!-- Iter --> | <!-- Key params --> | <!-- Brief description --> |

**Status**: <!-- ACTIVE / EXHAUSTED / EMERGING -->

### [Secondary Approach Name]

<!-- Same structure as above -->

---

## Approaches with Quality Ceilings

These approaches reliably produce good (but not top-tier) output due to structural limitations:

| Approach | Ceiling | Cause | Best Use |
|----------|---------|-------|----------|
| <!-- Approach --> | <!-- e.g., 4.5/5 --> | <!-- Root cause --> | <!-- When to use --> |

**Key insight**: Ceilings are valuable knowledge. These approaches are reliable for their tier — use them for consistent output, not for chasing top-tier.

## Unexplored High-Potential Paths

Based on partial evidence, these approaches may produce top-tier results but haven't been fully explored:

| Path | Evidence | Potential | Notes |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| <!-- Path --> | <!-- What suggests potential --> | <!-- HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW --> | <!-- Next steps --> |

## Diversification Strategy

### When Concentration is Structural

If top-tier results concentrate in one approach due to inherent properties:

1. **Accept it** — don't waste iterations trying to force alternatives
2. **Use deliberately** — the dominant path for "hero" outputs
3. **Diversify at lower tiers** — variety in reliable second-tier approaches
4. **Document why** — understanding prevents future wasted effort

### When Concentration is Strategic

If concentration is due to habit or comfort:

1. **Set diversity targets** — e.g., no single path >50% of top-tier
2. **Rotate exploration** — include underexplored paths each iteration
3. **Track and review** — monitor concentration at retrospectives

---

## Usage

At each meso-retrospective:
1. Update counts with new top-tier outputs
2. Check concentration percentages
3. Identify underexplored high-potential paths
4. Adjust exploration strategy if needed

**Remember**: Quality > Diversity. Never sacrifice output quality to force diversification.
