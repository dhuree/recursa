# Origin

This document captures the foundational context from when this system was bootstrapped. It preserves the original intent, requirements, and decisions that shaped the system's identity.

**This file should rarely change.** It serves as the system's "birth certificate" and primary reference for understanding why the system exists and what it was designed to do.

## Rationale for Key Decisions

Document why certain choices were made during bootstrap:

| Decision | Choice Made | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| [e.g., "Iteration length"] | [e.g., "2-3 hours"] | [e.g., "User prefers focused sessions"] |
| | | |

## Future Reference

When in doubt about the system's purpose or behavior, refer to this document. The answers here represent the original intent and should guide interpretation of ambiguous situations.

If the system needs to evolve beyond these original parameters, that evolution should be:
1. Documented in EVOLUTION.md
2. Approved by the human operator
3. Aligned with (or explicitly superseding) the values stated here
