# EXPERIMENTS.md — Hypothesis Testing

<!--
TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS:
This file tracks experiments—deliberate tests of hypotheses about what works.
LEARNING.md stores validated knowledge; EXPERIMENTS.md tracks the testing process.

## Purpose

Systematic experimentation accelerates learning. This document tracks:
- What we're testing
- How we're testing it
- What we've learned

## Active Experiments

### Experiment 1: [Experiment Name]

**Hypothesis**: [What you believe to be true]

**Why test this**: [What outcome would this knowledge enable?]

**Test Method**:
- [How you will test this]
- [What conditions you will control]
- [How many iterations/samples needed]

**Success Criteria**: [How you will know if the hypothesis is correct]

**Status**: [Not Started / In Progress / Analyzing / Complete]

**Start Date**: [Date]
**Target Completion**: [Date or iteration count]

**Observations**:
| Iteration | Observation | Supports/Challenges |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| [#] | [What happened] | [+/-/?] |

**Current Assessment**: [What the data suggests so far]

---

### Experiment 2: [Experiment Name]

**Hypothesis**: [What you believe to be true]

**Why test this**: [What outcome would this knowledge enable?]

**Test Method**: [How you will test]

**Success Criteria**: [Definition of success]

**Status**: [Status]

**Observations**:
| Iteration | Observation | Supports/Challenges |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| [#] | [What happened] | [+/-/?] |

- [ ] Modified approach in [document]

**Completed**: [Date]

## Experiment Design Guidelines

### Good Experiments Have

1. **Clear hypothesis**: Specific, testable statement
2. **Defined method**: How exactly you will test
3. **Success criteria**: How you'll know the answer
4. **Controlled variables**: What stays constant
5. **Sufficient sample**: Enough iterations for confidence

### Experiment Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **A/B Test** | Compare two approaches | "Method A vs Method B for [task]" |
| **Exploration** | Discover possibilities | "What happens if I try [approach]?" |
| **Validation** | Confirm existing belief | "Is [pattern] actually reliable?" |
| **Optimization** | Find best parameters | "What's the optimal [variable]?" |

### Minimum Viable Experiment

For quick tests:
1. State hypothesis in one sentence
2. Run 3 iterations with the approach
3. Note observations
4. Make preliminary conclusion
5. Decide whether to continue testing

## Experiment Metrics

Track experimentation health:

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Active experiments | [N] | 1-3 |
| Completed this month | [N] | [target] |
| Hypotheses confirmed | [N] | — |
| Hypotheses refuted | [N] | — |
| Inconclusive results | [N] | Minimize |

## Learning Integration

### From Experiment to Knowledge

```
Hypothesis [?]
    │
    ▼ (run experiment)
Observation [-]
    │
    ▼ (replicate 2+ times)
Pattern [*]
    │
    ▼ (understand causation)
Principle [P]
    │
    ▼
Document in LEARNING.md
```

### When to Experiment

- When you have an untested assumption
- When two approaches seem equally valid
- When you want to optimize something
- When a pattern needs validation

### When NOT to Experiment

- When the cost of failure is too high
- When existing knowledge clearly applies
- When there's no hypothesis, just random trying
- When you're avoiding actual work

---

## Failed Experiment Archive

Learning from what didn't work is valuable.

### [Failed Experiment Name]

**Hypothesis**: [What was tested]

**Why it failed**:
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]

**What was learned**: [The lesson from the failure]

**Would retry if**: [Conditions that might make it worth revisiting]

## Experiment Ideas

Raw ideas for future experiments, not yet formalized.

- [ ] [Experiment idea 1]
- [ ] [Experiment idea 2]
- [ ] [Experiment idea 3]

## Review Questions

Ask during retrospectives:

1. What assumptions am I making that could be tested?
2. What patterns have I noticed that need validation?
3. Are my active experiments still relevant?
4. Am I acting on experiment results?

## Integration

### With LEARNING.md
- Successful experiments feed validated knowledge
- LEARNING.md hypotheses become experiments

### With METRICS.md
- Experiment metrics tracked quantitatively
- A/B tests use METRICS criteria

### With LOOP.md
- Experiments are conducted during iterations
- Retrospectives review experiment progress
