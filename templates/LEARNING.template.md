# Learning Log

<!--
TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Customize categories for your domain
2. Add initial knowledge as it's discovered
3. Use knowledge level indicators
4. Remove this instruction block when done
-->

Essential knowledge accumulated through iteration.

See MEMORY.md for how knowledge flows.
See METRICS.md for quantitative validation.

## Knowledge Levels

| Level | Symbol | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Principle | [P] | High confidence, causally understood |
| Pattern | [*] | Confirmed 3+ times, reliable |
| Observation | [-] | Single data point, needs validation |
| Hypothesis | [?] | Untested, based on reasoning |

---

## Key Discoveries

### [Category 1]

<!-- Add discoveries as they emerge -->

### [Category 2]

<!-- Add discoveries as they emerge -->

### [Category 3]

<!-- Add discoveries as they emerge -->

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

| Category | Issue | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| <!-- Category --> | <!-- Anti-pattern --> | <!-- Root cause --> |

---

## Cross-Category Patterns

Insights that apply across multiple categories:

| Pattern | Categories | Insight |
|---------|------------|---------|
| <!-- Pattern name --> | <!-- Where it applies --> | <!-- The learning --> |

---

## Hypotheses to Test

Track untested ideas:

| ID | Hypothesis | Category | Status | Outcome |
|----|------------|----------|--------|---------|
| H001 | <!-- Hypothesis --> | <!-- Category --> | Open | - |

**Status values**: Open → Testing → Confirmed/Refuted

---

## Unexplored Territory

Areas not yet investigated:

1. <!-- Unexplored area 1 -->
2. <!-- Unexplored area 2 -->
3. <!-- Unexplored area 3 -->

---

## Knowledge Evolution Log

Track how understanding changes:

| Date | Change | From | To |
|------|--------|------|-----|
| <!-- Date --> | <!-- Description --> | <!-- Previous --> | <!-- Updated --> |

---

## Capture Template

When adding new knowledge:

```markdown
### [Category]
- **[Level] [Discovery title]**: [Description]
  - First observed: [iteration/context]
  - Confirmed by: [subsequent validations]
  - Conditions: [when this applies]
```

**Example**:
```markdown
### Data Processing
- **[*] Batch size 64 optimal for this dataset**: Larger batches cause memory issues, smaller batches slow training
  - First observed: Iteration 12
  - Confirmed by: Iteration 15, 18, 22
  - Conditions: When using GPU with 8GB VRAM
```

---

## Periodic Review

### Every [N] Iterations

Questions to ask:

1. **What new observations are ready for promotion?**
   - Any observation confirmed 3+ times?

2. **What patterns are strengthening?**
   - Increase confidence where validated

3. **What contradictions exist?**
   - Resolve or note as context-dependent

4. **What should be pruned?**
   - Remove disproven or obsolete knowledge

5. **What gaps exist?**
   - Add to unexplored territory

---

## The Learning Imperative

**Every iteration should add to this document.**

If iterations pass without new entries, something is wrong:
- Not observing carefully enough
- Not capturing observations
- Stuck in exploitation, not exploring

Knowledge compounds. Feed the compound.
