# Learning Archive

<!--
TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use this file to archive content removed from LEARNING.md during compaction
2. Preserve traceability - note archive date and what was removed
3. Structure by category for easy reference if needed later
4. Remove this instruction block when done
-->

Archived content from LEARNING.md — stale hypotheses, verbose per-experiment narratives, and redundant observations that have been consolidated into patterns/principles in the main file.

**Date archived**: [DATE]
**Pre-compaction size**: [SIZE]KB
**Post-compaction size**: [SIZE]KB

## Archived Hypotheses (Tested/Refuted)

These [?] entries were tested and resolved. The outcomes are captured as [-], [*], or [P] entries in LEARNING.md.

| ID | Hypothesis | Outcome |
|----|-----------|---------|
| H001 | [Hypothesis text] | Confirmed/Refuted: [brief reason] |

---

## Archived Verbose Experiment Narratives

### [Category 1] — [Description] (N entries consolidated)

Individual experiment details:
- [Experiment 1]: [brief notes], [rating]
- [Experiment 2]: [brief notes], [rating]
- **Consolidated finding**: [What's now in LEARNING.md]

### [Category 2] — [Description]

[Same pattern]

---

## Archived Redundant Pattern Reinforcement Entries

These entries repeated confirmations for patterns already well-established:

- [Pattern name]: N separate "CONTINUES/REINFORCED" entries removed
- [Pattern name]: N redundant confirmation entries

---

## Archived Attribution Notes

All "First observed: [experiment]" attribution lines have been removed from the main file. The experiment identifiers are preserved here if needed for traceability:

| Discovery | Original Experiment |
|-----------|---------------------|
| [Discovery] | [exp_xxx] |

---

## Archive Guidelines

**What to archive:**
- Tested hypotheses (preserve outcome)
- Verbose per-experiment narratives (consolidate key findings)
- Redundant "continues/reinforced" entries for established patterns
- "First observed" attribution notes (optional: preserve in table)

**What NOT to archive:**
- Active [P] principles
- Active [*] patterns with ongoing relevance
- Active [-] observations not yet promoted
- Anti-patterns (keep in main file)

**When to archive:**
- During scheduled knowledge compaction
- When LEARNING.md exceeds 500KB
- When observation count exceeds 500
