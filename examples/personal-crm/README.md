# Personal CRM

A self-improving relationship management system that learns to maintain and deepen connections effectively.

## Purpose

This system helps track relationships, remember important details, maintain appropriate contact cadences, and learn what works for building genuine connections with different people.

## Quick Start

1. Review system/SOUL.md for relationship philosophy
2. Follow docs/LOOP.md for interaction cycles
3. Build insights in docs/LEARNING.md
4. Track engagement via docs/METRICS.md
