# Iteration Loop

## Overview

Each research question or topic is one iteration. The goal is thorough understanding and synthesis.

---

## Phase 1: QUESTION (10 min)

### Actions
- [ ] Clarify the research question
- [ ] Identify what type of answer is needed
- [ ] Note existing knowledge (what do we already know?)
- [ ] Define scope and constraints

### Question Types
| Type | Characteristics | Approach |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| Factual | Has a definitive answer | Find authoritative source |
| Comparative | Evaluating options | Multi-source analysis |
| Exploratory | Understanding a domain | Broad survey |
| Synthetic | Combining ideas | Cross-source integration |

---

## Phase 2: SEARCH (20-40 min)

### Actions
- [ ] Identify search strategies from LEARNING.md
- [ ] Execute searches across relevant sources
- [ ] Evaluate source quality
- [ ] Collect relevant materials

### Source Types
| Type | When to Use | Quality Signals |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Academic papers | Deep understanding, citations | Peer review, citation count |
| Books | Comprehensive coverage | Author expertise, reviews |
| Official docs | Technical accuracy | Primary source |
| Expert content | Current thinking | Author credentials |
| News/blogs | Recent developments | Publication reputation |

### Search Strategy Log
| Strategy | Sources Found | Quality | Notes |
|----------|---------------|---------|-------|
| | | | |

## Phase 3: EXTRACT (30-60 min)

### Actions
- [ ] Read and understand each source
- [ ] Extract key claims and findings
- [ ] Note methodology and limitations
- [ ] Capture relevant quotes with citations

### Extraction Template
```markdown
## Source: [Title]
**Citation**: [Full citation]
**Type**: [Paper/Book/Article/etc.]
**Credibility**: [High/Medium/Low]

### Key Claims
1. [Claim] (p. X)
2. [Claim] (p. Y)

### Methodology
[How did they arrive at these conclusions?]

### Limitations
[What are the caveats?]

### Relevant Quotes
> "[Quote]" (p. Z)

### My Notes
[Interpretations, questions, connections]
```

---

## Phase 4: CONNECT (20-30 min)

### Actions
- [ ] Identify themes across sources
- [ ] Note agreements and contradictions
- [ ] Link to existing knowledge
- [ ] Update concept map

### Connection Types
| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Agreement | Sources A and B both find X |
| Contradiction | A says X, B says not-X |
| Extension | B builds on A's work |
| Application | A's theory explains B's data |
| Gap | Neither A nor B addresses Y |

### Contradiction Resolution
When sources conflict:
1. Check methodology quality
2. Consider context differences
3. Look for reconciling explanations
4. Note the uncertainty

---

## Phase 5: SYNTHESIZE (30-60 min)

### Actions
- [ ] Organize findings into coherent narrative
- [ ] Answer the original question
- [ ] Note confidence level
- [ ] Identify remaining gaps

### Synthesis Structure
```markdown
## Question
[Original research question]

## Short Answer
[1-2 sentence summary]

## Detailed Findings
[Organized presentation of what was learned]

## Confidence Assessment
[How sure are we? What's the evidence quality?]

## Sources
[Citations used]

## Open Questions
[What remains unknown?]
```

---

## Phase 6: CAPTURE (15 min)

### Actions
- [ ] Log metrics in METRICS.md
- [ ] Add new knowledge to LEARNING.md
- [ ] Update citation database
- [ ] Note search strategy effectiveness

### Capture Checklist
- [ ] Key facts added to knowledge base
- [ ] New connections documented
- [ ] Sources properly cited
- [ ] Search strategies evaluated
- [ ] Quality self-assessment recorded
