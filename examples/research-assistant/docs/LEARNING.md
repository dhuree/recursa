# Learning

Accumulated knowledge about effective research and domain expertise.

---

## Knowledge Levels

- `[P]` **Principle** - Causal understanding, highly reliable
- `[*]` **Pattern** - Confirmed 3+ times, use as heuristic
- `[-]` **Observation** - Single data point, needs validation
- `[?]` **Hypothesis** - Untested idea to explore

---

## Research Methodology

### Search Strategies
- `[*]` Starting with survey/review papers gives good overview
- `[*]` Following citation chains finds related work
- `[-]` Google Scholar's "cited by" feature useful for recent work
- `[?]` Semantic Scholar may surface more relevant papers

### Source Evaluation
- `[P]` Peer-reviewed sources more reliable than blogs
- `[*]` Author h-index correlates with reliability
- `[-]` Preprints should be treated with more skepticism
- `[?]` Industry white papers may have bias

### Reading Strategies
- `[*]` Abstract → Conclusion → Methods → Results is efficient
- `[-]` Reading the figures first gives quick overview
- `[?]` Highlighting key sentences improves retention

### Key Findings
- `[-]` [Finding from research]
- `[-]` [Finding from research]

### Open Questions in Field
- [Question that remains debated]
- [Question that remains debated]

## Source Quality Patterns

### High-Quality Indicators
- `[*]` Clear methodology section
- `[*]` Acknowledges limitations
- `[-]` Multiple independent replications

### Low-Quality Indicators
- `[*]` No citations or references
- `[*]` Extreme claims without evidence
- `[-]` Author has clear commercial interest

---

## Synthesis Patterns

### Effective Approaches
- `[*]` Organizing by theme works better than by source
- `[-]` Tables help compare across sources
- `[?]` Mind maps may help with complex topics

### Common Pitfalls
- `[*]` Overweighting recent sources
- `[-]` Missing foundational/classic works
- `[?]` Confirmation bias in source selection
