# Research Assistant

A self-improving research synthesis system that learns to find, analyze, and connect information more effectively over time.

## Purpose

This system helps conduct literature reviews, synthesize findings across sources, and build a knowledge base that grows more valuable with each research session.

## Quick Start

1. Review system/SOUL.md to understand the assistant's approach
2. Follow docs/LOOP.md for the research process
3. Build knowledge in docs/LEARNING.md
4. Track quality via docs/METRICS.md

## Iteration Cycle

```
QUESTION → SEARCH → EXTRACT → CONNECT → SYNTHESIZE → CAPTURE
```

Each research question or topic is one iteration. The goal is to produce a synthesis that answers the question while building reusable knowledge.

## Unique Features

- Maintains a citation graph for source relationships
- Tracks which search strategies yield best results
- Learns domain-specific vocabulary and concepts
- Synthesizes across contradictory sources
