# Iteration Loop

## Overview

Each study session is one iteration. The goal is effective learning with optimal retention.

---

## Phase 1: PLAN (5 min)

### Actions
- [ ] Check what's due for review (spaced repetition)
- [ ] Check what's new to learn
- [ ] Set session goal
- [ ] Estimate time needed

### Session Types
| Type | When | Focus |
|------|------|-------|
| New Material | Fresh topic | Understanding, initial encoding |
| Review | Spaced repetition due | Recall, reinforcement |
| Deep Work | Struggling area | Intensive practice |
| Mixed | Normal session | Balance of above |

### Due for Review
Check intervals based on last recall:
- Struggled (1-2/5): Review in 1 day
- Okay (3/5): Review in 3 days
- Good (4/5): Review in 1 week
- Excellent (5/5): Review in 2 weeks, then 1 month

---

## Phase 2: STUDY (25-50 min)

### Actions
- [ ] Focus on planned material
- [ ] Use active learning techniques
- [ ] Take breaks as needed (Pomodoro optional)
- [ ] Note confusion or difficulty

### Active Learning Techniques
| Technique | Best For | How |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Recall practice | Facts, concepts | Cover material, try to retrieve |
| Elaboration | Understanding | Explain in own words |
| Interleaving | Similar topics | Mix different problem types |
| Spaced practice | Long-term retention | Review over multiple sessions |
| Concrete examples | Abstract concepts | Generate specific instances |

### During Study
- Avoid passive re-reading
- Try to retrieve before checking
- Notice what's confusing
- Make connections to existing knowledge

---

## Phase 3: TEST (10-15 min)

### Actions
- [ ] Self-test on material covered
- [ ] Rate recall quality honestly
- [ ] Identify gaps
- [ ] Note what was hard vs. easy

### Recall Rating Scale
| Rating | Meaning | Next Review |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| 5/5 | Instant, effortless | Double interval |
| 4/5 | Correct with thought | Increase interval |
| 3/5 | Correct with effort | Maintain interval |
| 2/5 | Partially correct | Reduce interval |
| 1/5 | Forgot or wrong | Review tomorrow |

### Test Yourself
- Close notes, try to recall
- Explain concepts aloud
- Work practice problems
- Answer comprehension questions

---

## Phase 4: REFLECT (5 min)

### Actions
- [ ] Assess session effectiveness
- [ ] Note what worked/didn't work
- [ ] Identify technique improvements
- [ ] Rate overall session quality

### Reflection Questions
- Was I focused or distracted?
- Did the technique match the material?
- What would make this more effective?
- Am I actually understanding or just recognizing?

---

## Phase 5: SCHEDULE (5 min)

### Actions
- [ ] Update review dates for tested material
- [ ] Schedule next session
- [ ] Flag struggling items for extra attention
- [ ] Balance review load across days

### Spaced Repetition Logic
```
If recall = 5/5: next_review = current_interval * 2
If recall = 4/5: next_review = current_interval * 1.5
If recall = 3/5: next_review = current_interval
If recall = 2/5: next_review = current_interval / 2
If recall = 1/5: next_review = 1 day
```

---

## Phase 6: CAPTURE (5 min)

### Actions
- [ ] Log session metrics
- [ ] Update LEARNING.md with insights
- [ ] Record any technique experiments
- [ ] Note energy/focus level

---

## Cycle Frequencies

### Every Session (Micro)
- Complete full loop
- Log metrics

### Weekly (Meso)
- Review retention rates
- Assess study load balance
- Adjust techniques if needed

### Monthly (Macro)
- Comprehensive retention check
- Evaluate learning velocity
- Major technique adjustments
- Update long-term goals
