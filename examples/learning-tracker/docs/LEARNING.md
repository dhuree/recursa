# Learning

Meta-knowledge about how to learn effectively.

---

## Knowledge Levels

- `[P]` **Principle** - Causal understanding, highly reliable
- `[*]` **Pattern** - Confirmed 3+ times, use as heuristic
- `[-]` **Observation** - Single data point, needs validation
- `[?]` **Hypothesis** - Untested idea to explore

---

## Study Techniques

### What Works
- `[P]` Active recall beats passive re-reading
- `[P]` Spaced repetition dramatically improves retention
- `[*]` Teaching/explaining material deepens understanding
- `[*]` Interleaving topics better than blocked practice
- `[-]` Drawing diagrams helps for visual/spatial content
- `[?]` Pre-testing before learning may improve encoding

### What Doesn't Work
- `[P]` Highlighting and re-reading is ineffective
- `[*]` Cramming doesn't create lasting memory
- `[-]` Background music may hurt focus for complex material

---

## Session Optimization

### Timing
- `[*]` 25-50 min sessions work best (Pomodoro range)
- `[-]` Morning sessions have better focus
- `[?]` Post-exercise study may improve encoding
- `[?]` Pre-sleep review might consolidate memory

### Energy Management
- `[*]` Hard material when energy is high
- `[*]` Review sessions okay with lower energy
- `[-]` Caffeine helps if not dependent

## Subject-Specific Patterns

### [Subject 1]
- Best technique:
- Optimal session length:
- Common difficulties:

### [Subject 2]
- Best technique:
- Optimal session length:
- Common difficulties:

---

## Personal Learning Patterns

### When I Learn Best
- `[-]` Time of day:
- `[-]` Environment:
- `[-]` Session structure:

### Warning Signs
- `[*]` Re-reading without testing = false confidence
- `[-]` Fatigue leads to shallow processing
- `[?]` Frustration signals need for different approach

---

## Retention Patterns

### What Predicts Long-Term Retention
- `[P]` Successful recall during test phase
- `[*]` Emotional connection to material
- `[*]` Multiple connections to existing knowledge
- `[-]` Immediate review after learning

### What Predicts Forgetting
- `[*]` Passive exposure only
- `[*]` Isolated facts without context
- `[-]` Material learned when tired

---

## Spaced Repetition Insights

### Interval Adjustments
- `[-]` Default intervals may be too aggressive for complex material
- `[?]` Easier material could have longer starting intervals

### Review Load Management
- `[*]` 20-30 items per session is sustainable
- `[-]` Catching up on backlog is demoralizing

---

## Motivation & Consistency

### What Helps
- `[*]` Visible progress tracking
- `[*]` Small daily commitment vs. large sporadic sessions
- `[-]` Streak counting motivates consistency

### What Hurts
- `[*]` Perfectionism leading to avoidance
- `[-]` Comparing progress to others

- Optimal difficulty level for challenges
- Best way to learn procedural vs. declarative knowledge
- How to identify false familiarity
