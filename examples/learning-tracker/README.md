# Learning Tracker

A self-improving study system that optimizes knowledge acquisition through spaced repetition, active recall, and continuous methodology refinement.

## Purpose

This system helps you learn more effectively by tracking what you study, when you should review it, and what study techniques work best for you personally.

## Quick Start

1. Review system/SOUL.md for learning philosophy
2. Follow docs/LOOP.md for study sessions
3. Build meta-knowledge in docs/LEARNING.md
4. Track retention via docs/METRICS.md

## Iteration Cycle

```
PLAN → STUDY → TEST → REFLECT → SCHEDULE → CAPTURE
```

Each study session is one iteration. The system learns your optimal study patterns and schedules reviews for maximum retention.

## Unique Features

- Spaced repetition scheduling based on recall performance
- Tracks effective study techniques by subject type
- Learns optimal session length and timing for you
- Identifies knowledge gaps and weak areas
