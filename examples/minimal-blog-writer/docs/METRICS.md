# Metrics & Evaluation

Quantitative tracking enables data-driven improvement.

## Philosophy

**"What gets measured gets improved."**

But also: **"Not everything measured matters, and not everything that matters can be measured."**

Balance numbers with judgment.

## Core Metrics

### Per-Post Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Quality rating** | Self-assessed 1-5 scale | 4+ average |
| **Word count** | Total words | 1000-2000 |
| **Code examples** | Number of runnable snippets | 2-5 |
| **Time to complete** | Total hours from start to ready | 4-6 hours |
| **Revision rounds** | Major rewrites needed | <2 |

### Cumulative Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Posts per month** | Completed posts | 4+ |
| **4+ star rate** | Posts rated 4/5 or higher | 80%+ |
| **Discoveries per month** | New entries in LEARNING.md | 5+ |

## Quality Rating Scale

| Rating | Name | Criteria |
|--------|------|----------|
| **5/5** | Exceptional | Would proudly share anywhere. Clear, accurate, engaging. Readers will bookmark this. |
| **4/5** | Strong | Solid, publishable content. Minor improvements possible but not necessary. |
| **3/5** | Adequate | Gets the job done. Not memorable. Some clarity or depth issues. |
| **2/5** | Weak | Significant problems. Needs major revision before publishing. |
| **1/5** | Failed | Don't publish. Start over or abandon topic. |

### Rating Guidance

**5/5 requires ALL of**:
- Every code example tested and working
- A junior developer could follow without confusion
- Provides genuine insight, not just documentation rehash
- Engaging opening and satisfying conclusion

**Common deductions**:
- Code example with bugs: -2 points minimum
- Unclear explanation of key concept: -1 point
- Missing practical takeaway: -1 point
- Typos or formatting issues: -0.5 point

## Retrospective Template

### Every 5 Posts

```markdown
## Retrospective: Posts [X] to [Y]

### Summary
- Total posts: [N]
- Average rating: [X/5]
- 4+ rate: [X]%

### Highlights
- Best post: [Title] ([rating])
- Most improved area: [Description]

### Concerns
- Weakest post: [Title] ([rating])
- Pattern of issues: [Description]

### Actions
- [ ] [Specific improvement to try]
- [ ] [Specific improvement to try]
```

## Trigger Actions

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 3 consecutive posts below 4/5 | Review and adjust process |
| Topic not covered in 2+ months | Add to backlog |
| Same issue appears 3+ times | Add to anti-patterns |
| No discoveries in 3 posts | Force experimentation |
| Average time > 7 hours | Investigate bottleneck |

## Avoiding Pitfalls

### Goodhart's Law
Don't inflate ratings to hit targets. Honest metrics are the only useful metrics.

### Vanity Metrics
Avoid tracking things that don't drive improvement. Focus on actionable metrics.

### Over-Measurement
Start simple. Add metrics only when they'd change decisions.

---

## The Metrics Imperative

**Track consistently. Analyze honestly. Act decisively.**

Metrics transform gut feelings into knowledge.
