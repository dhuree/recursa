## Active Experiments

### Experiment 1: Code-First vs Explanation-First

**Hypothesis**: Starting with a working code example, then explaining it, leads to clearer posts than explaining concepts first.

**Why test this**: Could significantly improve reader comprehension.

**Test Method**:
- Write 3 posts code-first
- Write 3 posts explanation-first
- Rate clarity on both approaches
- Get reader feedback if available

**Success Criteria**: One approach has 20%+ higher clarity rating

**Status**: Not Started

**Observations**:
| Post | Approach | Clarity Rating | Notes |
|------|----------|----------------|-------|

**Current Assessment**: No data yet

### Experiment 2: Optimal Post Length

**Hypothesis**: Posts between 1000-1200 words perform better than shorter or longer posts.

**Why test this**: Finding the sweet spot maximizes value per post.

**Test Method**:
- Track word count per post
- Correlate with quality ratings
- Identify optimal range

**Success Criteria**: Clear correlation between length and quality

**Status**: Not Started

**Observations**:
| Post | Word Count | Quality Rating |
|------|------------|----------------|
