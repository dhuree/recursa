## Step 1: Prepare (30-60 min)

### Choose Topic
```
□ Check topic backlog for ideas
□ Consider reader questions/feedback
□ Verify topic hasn't been covered recently
□ Confirm you have (or can get) expertise
```

### Research
```
□ Gather authoritative sources
□ Set up test environment
□ Note any existing tutorials to differentiate from
□ Identify the "aha moment" to build toward
```

### Outline
```
□ Define the reader's starting point
□ List key concepts to cover
□ Plan code examples
□ Identify the practical takeaway
```

---

## Step 2: Draft (2-3 hours)

### Write the Content
1. **Hook**: Start with a problem the reader has
2. **Context**: Brief background (don't overdo it)
3. **Core content**: Explain with examples
4. **Code**: Working, tested examples
5. **Summary**: Recap and next steps

### As You Write
- Keep sentences short
- One idea per paragraph
- Use headers liberally
- Include code early and often

### Capture Observations
```
□ What's harder to explain than expected?
□ What assumptions am I making?
□ Where do I need more research?
```

---

## Step 3: Test (30-60 min)

### Code Verification
```
□ Run every code example
□ Test in clean environment
□ Verify expected outputs
□ Check edge cases mentioned
```

### Technical Accuracy
```
□ Verify claims with sources
□ Check version compatibility
□ Confirm API details are current
□ Review terminology
```

### Fix Issues
- If code fails: fix it (never ship broken examples)
- If claims are wrong: correct them
- If unclear: add explanation

---

## Step 4: Edit (30-60 min)

### Clarity Pass
```
□ Can a junior developer follow this?
□ Are technical terms explained?
□ Is the flow logical?
□ Are transitions smooth?
```

### Polish Pass
```
□ Remove filler words
□ Tighten sentences
□ Check for repetition
□ Verify headers are descriptive
```

### Final Checks
```
□ Links work
□ Code formatting correct
□ Images display properly
□ Reading time reasonable
```

---

## Step 5: Capture (15-30 min)

### Rate the Output

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 5/5 | Exceptional: clear, accurate, engaging, would share proudly |
| 4/5 | Strong: solid content, might have minor improvements possible |
| 3/5 | Adequate: gets the job done but not memorable |
| 2/5 | Weak: significant issues with clarity or accuracy |
| 1/5 | Failed: don't publish, needs major rework |

**This post's rating**: ___/5

### Log in METRICS.md
```markdown
| [Date] | [Title] | [X/5] | [Topic] | [Notes] |
```

### Update LEARNING.md
- What technique worked well?
- What should I avoid next time?
- Any new pattern discovered?

### Write Reflection
In journal/reflections/:
```markdown
## Post: [Title]
**Date**: [Date]
**Rating**: [X/5]

### What Worked
- [Specific technique or approach]

### What Didn't
- [Specific issue or struggle]

### For Next Time
- [Actionable improvement]
```

---

## Review Cycles

### After Every Post (Micro)
- Complete Steps 1-5 above
- Typical duration: 4-6 hours

### Every 5 Posts (Meso)
```markdown
## Retrospective: Posts [X] to [Y]

### Quality Trend
- Average rating: [X/5]
- Best post: [Title]
- Weakest post: [Title]

### Patterns Emerging
- What's consistently working?
- What's consistently struggling?

### Process Changes
- Any adjustments to the loop?
```

### Every 20 Posts (Macro)
Full strategic review:
- Are topics resonating with readers?
- Is quality improving over time?
- What skills need development?

## The Loop Imperative

**Every post should leave you a better writer than before.**

The loop is not overhead—it is the mechanism of improvement.
