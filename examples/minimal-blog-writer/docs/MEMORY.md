# Memory System

How BlogCraft preserves knowledge across iterations.

---

## Philosophy

Every blog post written teaches something. Memory ensures those lessons compound over time.

### Core Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Nothing is lost** | Every discovery gets captured in LEARNING.md |
| **Everything connects** | Knowledge links to outcomes |
| **Patterns emerge** | Repeated observations become heuristics |
| **System reflects** | Regular review of accumulated knowledge |

## Memory Architecture

### Document Hierarchy

```
docs/
├── MEMORY.md       # This file: how memory works
├── LEARNING.md     # Long-term knowledge
├── METRICS.md      # Quantitative tracking
├── EVOLUTION.md    # Self-improvement
├── GOALS.md        # Current objectives
├── EXPERIMENTS.md  # Hypothesis testing
└── LOOP.md         # Iteration process
```

### Memory Flow

```
WRITE ──→ EVALUATE ──→ CAPTURE ──→ APPLY

## Knowledge Types

### Writing Patterns

Things that work well when writing blog posts.

**Format**:
```markdown
### [Pattern Name]
**What**: [Description]
**When to use**: [Context]
**Example**: [Concrete example]
```

### Anti-Patterns

Things to avoid.

**Format**:
```markdown
### [Anti-Pattern Name]
**Avoid**: [What not to do]
**Why it fails**: [Root cause]
**Instead**: [What to do instead]
```

### Topic Knowledge

Facts and techniques learned about specific topics.

### Process Improvements

Refinements to the writing workflow.

## Knowledge Levels

Track confidence in each piece of knowledge:

| Level | Symbol | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Principle | [P] | High confidence, well understood |
| Pattern | [*] | Reliable, 3+ confirmations |
| Observation | [-] | Single data point, needs validation |
| Hypothesis | [?] | Untested idea |

---

## Memory Operations

### After Each Post (Capture)

1. What worked well?
2. What didn't work?
3. What would I do differently?
4. Any new patterns observed?

### Every 5 Posts (Review)

1. Which observations are ready for promotion?
2. Any patterns emerging?
3. Any contradictions to resolve?

### Every 20 Posts (Consolidate)

1. Organize knowledge by category
2. Prune outdated information
3. Update SOUL.md if patterns suggest changes

## Integration

### With LOOP.md
- Before writing: Consult LEARNING.md
- After writing: Update LEARNING.md

### With METRICS.md
- Quantitative validation of patterns
- Trend data for knowledge confidence

### With EVOLUTION.md
- Meta-analysis of learning effectiveness
- Improvement of memory system itself

## The Memory Imperative

**Post 100 should benefit from posts 1-99.**

Memory is not optional overhead—it is the mechanism of improvement.
