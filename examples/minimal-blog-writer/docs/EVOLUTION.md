## Meta-Evolution

How the evolution process itself improves:

### Questions to Ask Periodically

- Are metrics meaningful and actionable?
- Is the iteration cycle efficient?
- What's blocking faster improvement?

### Signs of Healthy Evolution

- LEARNING.md grows with useful patterns
- Quality metrics trend upward
- Process becomes smoother over time
- Fewer repeated mistakes

### Signs of Unhealthy Evolution

- Same mistakes recurring
- Metrics stagnant or declining
- Learning not translating to improvement
- Process becoming more complex without benefit
